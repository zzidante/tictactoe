# Tic Tac Toe

This is an experiment in using alpha-beta trees to build an unbeatable tic-tac-toe bot. It also utilized many modern UI browser features like css-grids and css --variables.

## To Get Started

- download repo
- open index.html
- play game! (on Chrome || Firefox)

## Current Looks

### You can play with a friend _but_ it currently has no game aware validation and you'll have to share the screen. Coming Soon!
